In detail

For a manual test, we got a PO (Miguel) to play with the system.
We began by creating a profile for him. Create name=Miguel.... dateOfBirth=...... nhi=ASD9876
From here, we updated his date of birth. This transaction failed, as we had a bug. 
When we went to view, his datOfBirth was still the same.
He then attempted to update his donatble organs. This transaction completed fine.
When we went to view the updated organs, nothing showed up. There was a bug where the organs hadn't changed to true, so were not printed out.
These bugs, found my manualling testing were then fixed once the testing had finished.

**Exporting a Donor**
*Test Procedure*

1. Run the command 'mvn clean install package' in the base directory of the project.
2. Run the application with the command 'java -jar app-0.0.jar'.
3. Add a new account by entering 'create name=William Henry Harrison dateOfBirth=17730209 nhi=WHH0009'.
4. Update organs with the command 'update NHI WHH0009 organs all true'.
5. Export the donors to the file 'manualExportTest.json' by entering 'export manualExportTest'.
6. Open the file 'manualExportTest.json' in a text editor.
7. Confirm that all attributes of the account have been serialized successfully and that the file is human readable.
8. Terminate the test.

*Test Record*
13-03-2018 15:55 Test successful. However, as noted by the team earlier, a null gender value is recorded in the JSON file as the null character. This appears to have no effect on functionality.


**Importing a Donor**
*Test Procedure*
1. Run the command 'mvn clean install package' in the base directory of the project.
2. Copy the file 'validImportAccountsTest.json' from the base directory to the target directory.
3. Run the application with the command 'java -jar app-0.0.jar'.
4. Attempt to import a file which does not exist in the target directory using 'import xyz'. An error message should appear. If not, terminate the test and report a failure.
5. Attempt to import 'validImportAccountsTest.json' with 'import validImportAccountsTest.json'.
6. Use command 'view donors all' to confirm that the account has been added.
7. Terminate the test.
